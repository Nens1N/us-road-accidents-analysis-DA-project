US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis For Data Analysis Project

## Project Context
This project analyzes road accident data from the United States to uncover patterns, trends, and contributing factors. The goal is to provide insights that could aid in improving road safety and traffic management. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we examine factors like accident frequency, time of day, and accident severity.

## Outcomes
- Identified peak times and days for accidents.
- Visualized accident frequency across states and cities.
- Gained insights into the relationship between traffic density and accident rates.

## Pre-requisites
Before running the analysis, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (or Jupyter Notebook)
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation)
  - `matplotlib` (for data visualization)
  - `seaborn` (for advanced visualizations)
  - `numpy` (for numerical operations)
  - `scikit-learn` (optional, if you apply machine learning models)
